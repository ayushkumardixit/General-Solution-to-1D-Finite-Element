# General-Solution-to-1D-Finite-Element
Displacements, Strains and Stress values in a general 1D bar element can be calculated using the codes. User will have to input the total number of element, type of element(linear or quadratic), material properties(length, area and young's modulus ). Codes are able to compute displacement, strain and stress and at location using the interplation.
